Go here for a real implementation -> [WeebSearch](https://github.com/Xetera/WeebSearch)

trying to see how fast I can index and retrieve that data
- [x] Trie for storing data (works, could've just used a map but meh)
- [ ] Crawlers (have a weird bug)
- [ ] Intersection algorithm ([This paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/fast-set-intersection-in-memory/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fpubs%2F173795%2Fvldb11intersection.pdf))
- [ ] Site (will probably never happen lul)
